    "# Analysis of life expectancy of developing countries in 2015\n",
    "\n",
    "### * Problem:\n",
    "This project shows approaches the formulation of a model that can describe life expectancy of third world countries in an specific year, 2015 in this case.\n",
    "### * Purpose:\n",
    "Obtaining a model in this project is useful in further studies for predicting how is life expectancy changing across the years.\n",
    "### * Dataset:\n",
    "The data used in this model was obtained directly from Kaggle ([link to the repository](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)). This dataset was made taking The Global Health Observatory official repository website.\n",
    "### * Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modeling design: This procedure applies for both designed models, one uses the normal distributon and the other the gamma.\n",
    "    * Prior: Considering the normalized histogram, the values for the priors were selected manually just by trying to find a similarity with the original data histogram. Also, each parameter for the normal and gamma distributions were modelled as normal and with a standart deviation approximadelty as 30% of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Fiting: From obtaining a prior, the fiting was performed taking the normalized life expectency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Posterior prediction: In the same fiting stan model, it was generated a prediction using the same parameters fitted in one iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Models comparisson:\n",
    "    * Normalized histograms of original normalized data, prior and posterior prediction were plotted. Perhaps this does not give a quantified comparisson. It does show how posterior predicted fits better to original data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Both models were compared using WAIC and LOO information criteria. This does give quantified comparisson criteria.\n"

For this reason, it is used WAIC and LOO critreria for finding a the most accuarate model."
